## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What event is fired when a user places their cursor in a form control?
  focus
- What event is fired when a user's cursor leaves a form control?
  blur
- What event is fired as a user changes the value of a form control?
  input
- What event is fired when a user clicks the `"submit"` button within a `<form>`?
  submit
- What does the `event.preventDefault()` method do?
  It prevents the default pattern of behavior from executing, such as the behavior for submitting a form.
- What does submitting a form without `event.preventDefault()` do?
  The default behavior for submitting a form is to send off the data within the form and them refresh the page (emptying the form).
- What property of a form element object contains all of the form's controls.
  elements
- What property of a form control object gets and sets its value?
  name
- What is one risk of writing a lot of code without checking to see if it works so far?
  A flawed approach to solving a problem may be detected halfway through creating the approach if it is tested as it is built. Waiting until the entire program is built might be a time-waster. Additionally, testing a program as it is built can give a programmer a clue as to where an error lies. If a programmer waits until their programmer is fully written to test it, they'll have to scour their entire code to find and fix any problems.
- What is an advantage of having your console open when writing a JavaScript program?
  You can get immediate feedback with console logs to ensure you're doing what you think you're doing.

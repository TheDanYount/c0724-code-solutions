## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `<dialog>` element used for?
  Creating modals, such as a box for a username and password with a submit button popping up when you hit a "login" button on a navigation bar.
- How do you display a modal dialog?
  Either with the show() method, or with the showModal() method.
- How do you hide a modal dialog?
  With the close() method.
- What is the difference between the `showModal` & `show` methods?
  the showModal() method centers the modal, greys out the rest of the page, and blocks user-interaction with the rest of the page. The show() method merely reveals the dialog at its appropriate place indicated by its position in the DOM.

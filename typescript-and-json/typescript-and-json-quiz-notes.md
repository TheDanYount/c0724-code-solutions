## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSON?
  JavaScript Object Notation, "is a lightweight data-interchange format," meaning it is used to send and retrieve data.
- What are serialization and deserialization?
  Think of it like being transported and arriving in Star Trek. Rather than sending an object as data, sometimes it is better to use a simplified format. In JSON, objects can be converted into strings, sent to a server, and re-constructed into objects original to the ones the client wanted to send.
- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
  Sending objects to a server can be complicated. Serialization/deserialization accomplishes the same thing by a different (easier) means.
- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using TypeScript?
  Use the JSON.stringify(data-structure) method.
- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using TypeScript?
  Use the JSON.parse(string) method.

## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are arrays used for?
  Storing things in an indexed manner and manipulating the set with built-in array methods.
- Describe array literal notation.
  To the right of the assignment operator there should be brackets. That creates an array. Filling the brackets with comma separated values populates the array with those values.
- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?
  Arrays are indexed rather than using keys, and many array methods exist and function only on arrays because of that indexing.
- What number represents the first index of an array?
  Zero.
- What is the `length` property of an array?
  The number of items in the array, equal to the last index plus one.
- How do you calculate the last index of an array?
  Array.length - 1.

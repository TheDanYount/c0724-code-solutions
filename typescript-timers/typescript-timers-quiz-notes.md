## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a "callback" function?
  A callback function is one that is passed as an argument to another function. It typically runs after the function calling it has completed its other tasks.

- Besides adding an event listener callback function to an element or the `document`, what is one way to delay the execution of a JavaScript function until some point in the future?
  One can use the setTimeout method.

- How can you set up a function to be called repeatedly without using a loop?
  One can use the setInterval method.

- What is the default time delay if you omit the `delay` parameter from `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`?
  Zero milliseconds.

- What do `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return?
  setTimeout and setInterval return a positive integer (which can be used to cancel setTimeout with the clearTimeout method, or which can be used to cancel setInterval with the clearInterval method) (technically they're interchangeable, but use the correct one to improve readability).

- What is an absolute URL?
  It starts with http:// or https://, it links to a universal address on the web.
- What is a relative URL?
  It lists a path for the website to navigate to from the directory containing the current webpage i.e. ../images/cat.jpeg would link you to a parent directory, an images folder within it, and a cat.jpeg jpeg file within that folder, basically equivalent to telling someone which streets to turn on to get from their house to a destination, rather than the destination's address.

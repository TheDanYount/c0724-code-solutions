## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- When was TypeScript introduced?
  2012

- What does the TypeScript `Compiler` do?
  It turns typescript into javascript that can be run by a computer.
- How can you compile TypeScript to JavaScript?
  Run the code "tsc"
- What are some benefits of using TypeScript?
  As I see it, there's really only one: you'll never get type errors if you've
  written the code in typescript. I suppose one could subdivide this into writing better code and debugging faster.

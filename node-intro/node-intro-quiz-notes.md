## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the 3 components of a fullstack Web architecture?
  Frontend, backend, and database. Our React manages our frontend. We use postgreSQL for our database, and we use node.js for backend. The user interacts with the frontend. The backend takes requests and returns responses, and the database is where our data is stored.
- What is Node.js and why is it useful?
  Node.js is a runtime environment that lets us use JavaScript to create a server, even though JavaScript isn't inherently a backend language.
- What are environment variables and how do you access them in Node.js?
  Environment variables describe aspects of the runtime environment, such as HOSTNAME in this exercise. In Node.js you can access these with 'process.env'.
- What is a REPL?
  It stands for read evaluate print loop. It will read, evaluate, and print code (in node.js, JS code), and perpetually wait for more to be inputted.

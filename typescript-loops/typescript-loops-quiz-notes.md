## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  To repeat code until a condition is met. This is especially useful for checking a condition for each index of an array or each key of an object.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  To determine when a loop stops repeating. If a loop repeats endlessly, it crashes the program.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  'Instance' and/or 'time' would be synonymous e.g. in the following loop, during the first iteration i = 0, during the second iteration i = 1, and during the third iteration i = 2:
  for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++>) {}
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  Before each iteration.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  Before the first iteration.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  After the initialization, before each iteration.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  At the end of each iteration.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increases the value of the variable it is applied to by 1.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  With a for in loop e.g. for(key in object) {}

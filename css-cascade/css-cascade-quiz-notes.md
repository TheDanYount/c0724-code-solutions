## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".
  Importance, specificity, scoping proximity (how distant the ancestors are), and source order (latest has higher precedence).
- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
  That the last rule (all else equal) takes effect.
- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
  Inheritence
- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
  Tag, class, id.
- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
  It wrecks specificity, which is normally the relevant factor, and something which programmers tend to depend on (and for good reason).

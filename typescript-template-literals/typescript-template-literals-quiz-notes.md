## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

  A template literal is a string denoted by backticks rather than quotation marks or apostrophes. Within a template literal, variables can be added by placing them inside of the curly brackets in a "${}". This an easier alternative to concatenation.
- What is "string interpolation"?
  Interpolation is putting something of a different type into something. This commonly occurs in programming when one wants to put a variable into a string. It can be accomplished by concatenation or by using template literals (see last answer).

## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- How do controlled components differ from uncontrolled components?
  Controlled components keep track of their input in a state.
- What are some advantages of using uncontrolled components?
  You don't need to worry about your inputs until they're submitted. When you don't need to manage inputs as they come in, this can save you from having to write 20 different state variables for a form with 20 inputs.
- What are some advantages of using controlled components?
  You don't need to extract data from a submitted form when the data is already held in state variables. You have a dynamically updating value for the input value, letting you give the user input if their inputs are invalid.
- Which style do you prefer?
  Controlled, for the ability to give the user input about their inputs before they submit.
- What two props must you pass to an input for it to be "controlled"?
  An event handler and a value.
- What are some popular npm packages for creating forms in React?
  React Hook Form, Formik, and React Final Form.

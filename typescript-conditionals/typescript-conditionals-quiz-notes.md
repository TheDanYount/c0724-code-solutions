- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  Booleans.
- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  To run a subsequent code block only if the conditional statement returns true.

  With a comparison operator e.g. (2 + 3 < 1 + 5), as you would normally e.g. (5 < 6).
- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  It's an alternative to if statement, best used when checking a condition against several discreet possibilities.

## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSX?
  'JSX' means XML in JavaScript. It allows developers to write pseudo-html in their JavaScript, which can be converted into HTML far faster than writing a traditional HTML file.
- How does React use JSX to render components?
  When React calls a component function, the return is in JSX. React takes this JSX and transforms it into HTML, and then pushes the HTML into the DOM.

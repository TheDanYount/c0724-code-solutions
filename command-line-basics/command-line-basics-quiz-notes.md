## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a CLI?
  A command line interface e.g. windows powershell.
- What is a GUI?
  A graphical user interface, something containing graphics designed to facilitate user interaction.
- Give at least one use case for each of the commands listed in this exercise.

  - `man`
    When you've forgotten what a command does, or the flag for it, so you use the command man [command]
  - `cat`
    When you want to display multiple files at once use cat [file1] [file2]
  - `ls`
    When you want a list of files in your current directory use ls (use ls -a to list hidden files)
  - `pwd`
    After you've used cd a few times, if you want to verify you arrived at the correct destination, use pwd.
  - `echo`
    If you want to store a message in the terminal's history use echo, e.g. echo 'finished the edit feature today'
  - `touch`
    I use this often e.g. touch index.html
  - `mkdir`
    If you want to shave a couple seconds off the time it takes to make an images folder, rather than right-clicking in the appropriate spot and creating a new file and then inputting its name, simply use mkdir images.
  - `mv`
    If you've misnamed a file, simply use mv [wrongfilename] [correctfilename]
  - `rm`
    If you've copied a file and verified that it was copied correct, you might want to remove the original e.g. rm origfile.html
  - `cp`
    If you want to save your original file, but want to try out a slightly different approach, you might want to copy it e.g. cp origfile.html newfile.html

- What are the three virtues of a great programmer (as a programmer)?
  I'd say prudence, justice, and courage (i.e. maybe a little mono-mania isn't such a bad thing on occasion for a programmer).
